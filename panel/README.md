# Panel workspace architecture

`panel/` 使用 ports-and-adapters 边界。具体框架只允许出现在叶子适配器和最终组合根中；核心模型、用例编排和存储契约不依赖 Pingora、Tonic、SQL 或文件系统。

## Crate dependency direction

```text
panel-ir -> panel-domain
panel-engine -> panel-errors + panel-domain + panel-ir

panel-gateway-runtime -> panel-engine ports
snapshot-store-fs -> panel-engine::SnapshotStore
gateway-pingora -> panel-engine::DataPlaneAdapter
gateway-grpc -> panel-contracts + panel-engine::GatewayEngine

gatewayd -> runtime + filesystem adapter + Pingora adapter + gRPC adapter
```

箭头表示左侧 crate 依赖右侧 crate。

| Crate | Responsibility | Forbidden knowledge |
|---|---|---|
| `panel-errors` | Stable error codes and diagnostics | Domain, transport, storage, Pingora |
| `panel-domain` | Validated value objects | IR, transport, storage, Pingora |
| `panel-ir` | Versioned canonical runtime snapshot | Proto, storage, Pingora |
| `panel-engine` | `GatewayEngine`, `DataPlaneAdapter`, `SnapshotStore`, runtime-info ports and Fake | Proto, storage implementation, Pingora |
| `panel-gateway-runtime` | Prepare/Activate/CAS/LKG orchestration | Tonic, filesystem, Pingora |
| `snapshot-store-fs` | Versioned JSON records, fsync and atomic rename | Tonic, Pingora, runtime policy |
| `gateway-pingora` | Compile IR into private Pingora values and atomic `ArcSwap` publication | Proto, filesystem, control-plane policy |
| `gateway-grpc` | Proto/domain conversion, runtime-info projection and Tonic service | Pingora, filesystem, environment |
| `gatewayd` | Dependency construction, bind/readiness policies, environment configuration, process clock, worker executor and standard gRPC Health | Business rules |

`.github/scripts/check-panel-boundaries.sh` enforces these direct dependency rules in CI.
`gatewayd::build_gateway_transport` is the single composition factory used by both the production process and TCP black-box tests, preventing test-only dependency graphs from drifting away from production.

## Activation invariant

All fallible work required to build and durably publish the activation occurs
before the data-plane pointer swap:

```text
IR validation -> adapter prepare -> persist prepared record
-> compare active hash -> fsync active snapshot + receipt -> ArcSwap publish -> ACK
```

If durable commit fails before the atomic rename, the active pointer is unchanged. If the rename succeeds but directory synchronization is inconclusive, the store returns a typed `COMMIT_OUTCOME_UNKNOWN`; the runtime still aligns the data plane and in-memory state with the visible record, marks itself degraded, and requires recovery before further mutations. Prepare, activate, and abort run in request-independent tasks, so client cancellation cannot cancel an admitted durable transaction. A bounded semaphore applies fail-fast backpressure to running and queued mutations, an async mutex serializes them, and a `TaskTracker` drains admitted work during shutdown. `PINGORA_PANEL_MAX_PENDING_MUTATIONS` configures this bound and is validated before Tokio resources are constructed. If the process stops after durable commit but before publication or ACK, `DurableGatewayEngine::restore` recompiles and republishes the committed LKG. Retrying the same prepare token returns the stored activation receipt. Corrupt startup state keeps Status available in `NotReady` mode while all mutations fail closed.

## Compatibility fixtures and readiness

`snapshot-store-fs/tests/fixtures/v1` and `snapshot-store-fs/tests/fixtures/v2` are committed storage ABI fixtures. Tests must continue reading supported versions after implementation changes and must reject unknown format versions, truncated JSON, hash mismatches, and unsafe downgrades without rewriting the source record. A new storage format requires a new fixture directory and explicit migration path; existing fixtures are immutable.

`.github/scripts/check-panel-proto-breaking.sh` owns Protobuf compatibility enforcement. Pull requests compare against their target branch; default-branch pushes compare against the event's immutable `before` commit rather than the already-updated branch head. A missing predecessor module is treated only as the one-time bootstrap case; an invalid baseline fails closed. `resolve-panel-proto-baseline.sh` isolates event mapping, while `test-panel-proto-breaking.sh` uses a temporary Git repository and real Buf to verify bootstrap, additive evolution, deleted fields, changed types and reused field numbers.

`gatewayd` exposes the standard `grpc.health.v1.Health` service for both the overall server name (`""`) and the generated Gateway service name. Readiness comes from `GatewayEngine::status`: healthy or restored LKG state is `SERVING`; corrupt or incompatible startup state is `NOT_SERVING`. On shutdown, `ShutdownCoordinator` calls an abstract `ReadinessGate`, closes mutation admission atomically, waits the bounded drain window, and only then resolves Tonic's graceful-shutdown future. The custom Status RPC remains available for diagnostics and additively projects gateway/data-plane/adapter versions, process start time, monotonic uptime, configured worker count, completed recoveries, degraded transitions, and unknown commit outcomes through stable engine ports.

Until an authenticated transport is composed, `LoopbackOnlyManagementBindPolicy` rejects every non-loopback plaintext address. Bind validation is a policy port rather than an address-parser special case, so a future mTLS adapter can replace the policy explicitly. `GatewayWorkerCount` and `ShutdownPolicy` keep resource and drain limits valid before executor or server construction.

## Extension rules

1. Add a new engine without changing the runtime by implementing `DataPlaneAdapter` in a new leaf crate.
2. Add a new persistence backend by implementing `SnapshotStore`; backend format versions remain private to that adapter.
3. Add a new transport in its own crate and convert generated values only at that boundary.
4. Add process metadata through `GatewayRuntimeInfoProvider`; engines must not read clocks or environment variables.
5. Add authenticated management transports by implementing `ManagementBindPolicy`; never weaken the plaintext loopback default implicitly.
6. Add a health protocol by adapting `ReadinessGate`; shutdown sequencing must not depend on a concrete health implementation.
7. Extend Proto additively. Never expose generated Proto or Pingora structs from stable ports.
8. Evolve IR through a new schema version and explicit migrator; do not silently reinterpret persisted snapshots.
9. Keep `gatewayd` as a composition root. It may wire dependencies but must not acquire domain rules.
10. Prefer one canonical port or value type per concept. During internal development, remove superseded APIs instead of maintaining duplicate compatibility layers.

## Revision lifecycle policy

`panel-config-domain` models one immutable revision attempt. `Failed`,
`Rejected`, and `Superseded` are terminal states by design: a transient gateway
or operator failure ends that revision attempt rather than reopening it. A retry
creates a new revision, preserving an auditable one-attempt-to-one-lifecycle
history. If a future product needs retries for the same revision identity, add a
separate attempt aggregate instead of introducing a `Failed -> Preparing`
transition to this state machine.
